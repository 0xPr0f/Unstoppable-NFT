# Unstoppable NFT

## This is a project by 0xProf for the Unstoppable domain hackathon

Unstoppable NFT is a domain gated application
i.e you must own a unstoppable domain to access it
this idea was inspired by token gating but then to encourage users to get a UD domain

## How is works

You will log into a page where you will confirm your ownership of a UD domain
then after confirmation you will be automatically be redirected to the DApp
