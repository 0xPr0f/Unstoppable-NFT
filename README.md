# Unstoppable NFT

## This is a project by 0xProf for the Unstoppable domain hackathon

Unstoppable NFT is a domain gated application
i.e you must own a unstoppable domain to access it
this idea was inspired by token gating but then to encourage users to get a UD domain

## How is works

You will log into a page where you will confirm your ownership of a UD domain
then after confirmation you will be automatically be redirected to the DApp

## How to run it

If you want to run the app, you can clone the app but it will require and additional folder hidden with the gitignore
you can hit me up on discord 0xProf#7686 for the proper steps, configuration and all the required info/files to be able to run the application on localhost
