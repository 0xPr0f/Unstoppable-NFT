# Unstoppable NFT

## This is a project by 0xProf for the Unstoppable domain hackathon

Unstoppable NFT is a domain gated application
i.e you must own a unstoppable domain to access it
this idea was inspired by token gating but then to encourage users to get a UD domain

## How is works

You will be logged into a page where you will confirm your ownership of a UD domain
then after confirmation you will be automatically redirected to the DApp where you can
buy, sell and create NFTs that are Unique and do some other stuffs.  
### *Unstoppable domain was integrated into my submission for the eth global web3jam hackathon*
check out the submission: https://showcase.ethglobal.com/web3jam/metax

## How to run it

If you want to run the app, you can clone the app with
```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xPr0f/Unstoppable-NFT.git
```
and then 
```sh
cd Unstoppable-NFT
```
and then 
```sh
npm i
```
and then start the serve
```sh
npm start
```
but it will fail considering that the application param is not set properly and it will require an additional folder hidden with the gitignore
you can hit me up on discord @ 0xProf#7686 for the proper steps and all the required info to be able to run the application @ localhost
